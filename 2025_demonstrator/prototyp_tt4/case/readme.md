# TT04 Protoype Case

For the 2025 Demonstrator prototype, a case has been modeled to be made out of wooden panels that can be cut with a laser and put together with minimal or no glue.
The model was made using Autodesk Fusion 360, and all laser cut parts have been exported as a DXF-File to be imported into the laser cutter software. A few rendered perspectives and 3D models have been exported as well.
An Emblaser 2, controlled by LightBurn 1.3.01 cutting Kraftplex ST 1.5mm 30x40 cm sheets was used.
